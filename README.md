# static_site_generator

A static site is what it sounds like... static. No matter who is interacting with the site, the content is always the same. You cannot log in, you can't leave comments, or upload files to a static site. You would need a dynamic site for that stuff, which is usually powered by a database and a custom web server.

Some popular production-ready static site generators include:

- Eleventy
- Gatsby
- Astro
- Jekyll
- Hugo
